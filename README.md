Welcome to Solution of Question 3 !
My Bot is hosting here : https://botmind-question3.herokuapp.com/
However you can't chat with him because you're not his owner...

If you want you can create your ownn and replace access token in .env

Warning : to discuss with API you need to have a public https URL
Host him on heroku, glitch or use ngrok for local testing
